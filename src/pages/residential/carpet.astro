    question: 'What type of carpet is best for bedrooms?',
    answer: 'Plush or frieze carpet in nylon or polyester is ideal for bedrooms. These styles offer comfort underfoot, warmth, and noise reduction. We can help you choose the right fiber, weight, and pad for your bedroom based on traffic and preferences.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is carpet a good choice if I have pets?',
    answer: 'Yes, with the right product. Solution-dyed nylon and polyester carpets resist staining and are easy to clean. Look for low-loop or cut-pile styles that will not snag on pet claws. We can recommend pet-friendly products during your consultation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How often does carpet need to be replaced?',
    answer: 'Residential carpet typically lasts 8-15 years depending on quality, traffic, and maintenance. Bedrooms and low-traffic areas last longer. Regular vacuuming and periodic professional cleaning extend carpet life significantly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you remove old carpet?',
    answer: 'Yes. We handle complete removal of your existing carpet and padding, including disposal. If the subfloor needs any preparation after removal, we take care of that too — everything is included in our proposal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can carpet help with noise?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Carpet is one of the best flooring options for sound absorption. It reduces footstep noise, echo, and sound transfer between floors — making it ideal for bedrooms, family rooms, and upper-story rooms.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does carpet installation take?',
    answer: 'Most single-room carpet installations are completed in one day. Whole-home carpet projects typically take 2-4 days depending on the number of rooms and any subfloor preparation needed.',
  },

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Carpet remains one of the most popular flooring choices for residential bedrooms, family rooms, playrooms, home offices, and stairs. It provides warmth, comfort, noise reduction, and a cozy feel that hard-surface floors cannot match. Modern residential carpets come in a wide range of fibers, styles, and colors, making it easy to find the perfect option for any room and lifestyle.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 mt-12">Installation Notes</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Carpet installation begins with removing your existing flooring (if needed) and preparing the subfloor. We install tack strips, lay quality padding, and stretch the carpet for a smooth, wrinkle-free finish. Seams are carefully placed and edges are tucked for a clean look. Stairs require individual fitting and wrapping for a tight, professional finish. Most rooms are completed in a single day, and furniture is moved back into place as we go.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-6 mt-12">Maintenance Basics</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Vacuum your carpet at least twice a week in high-traffic areas and once a week in lower-traffic rooms. Treat spills immediately by blotting (not rubbing) with a clean cloth. Schedule professional deep cleaning every 12-18 months to remove embedded dirt and extend carpet life. Use doormats at entrances to reduce tracked-in dirt. We provide specific care recommendations based on your carpet's fiber type.
